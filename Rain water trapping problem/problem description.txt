💧 What is the Trapping Rain Water problem?
Imagine you have bars of different heights arranged in a row (like buildings). When it rains, water gets trapped between the bars. You want to find out how much water is trapped.
 


🧱 Example array:
Let's say the bar heights are:
arr = [3, 0, 2, 0, 4]
⦁	Bar 0 has height 3
⦁	Bar 1 has height 0 (very small)
⦁	Bar 2 has height 2
⦁	Bar 3 has height 0 (again small)
⦁	Bar 4 has height 4 (tall)

💡 How is water trapped?
Water gets trapped only when there are taller bars on both sides of a small bar.

To calculate water trapped on top of each bar:
water_at_i = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i]
left_max[i]: tallest bar on the left including itself
right_max[i]: tallest bar on the right including itself

✅ Step-by-Step Solution:
Build left_max (from left to right):
left_max = [3, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Build right_max (from right to left):
right_max = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
Water trapped at each position:
water[0] = min(3, 4) - 3 = 0
water[1] = min(3, 4) - 0 = 3
water[2] = min(3, 4) - 2 = 1
water[3] = min(3, 4) - 0 = 3
water[4] = min(4, 4) - 4 = 0
Total water = 0 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 7

So, 7 units of water are trapped between the bars.
